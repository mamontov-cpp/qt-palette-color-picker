* A widget, not a dialog
* A palette cells are placed near each other, so you can see, how colors are contrasting which each other
* If a palette is too small for you, you can see cells from it, along with selected cell in preview part, located at bottom left corner
* You can use WASD keys to move selection cursor on the color wheel, FR keys to increase or decrease lightness, TG keys to increase or decrease alpha channel, changing color of selected palette cell, after you click on the widget.
